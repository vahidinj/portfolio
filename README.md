## Personal/Working Projects

### Diabetes Prediction App: [GitHub Repository Link](https://github.com/vahidinj/diabetes_prediction_app)

This is a Streamlit-based web application designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on diagnostic measurements. The app includes features for data exploration, model evaluation, and interactive visualizations to help users better understand the dataset and model performance.

**Key Features:**
- User-friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for seamless interaction.
- Data Exploration: Visualize and analyze diagnostic data.
- Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of predictive models.
- Interactive Visualizations: Gain insights into the dataset and predictions.
- Batch Predictions: Make batch predictions by uploading a CSV and downloading the results.

## Work Experiences

### **Senior Operations Research Analyst, Department of Defense, Warren, MI | Aug 2016 â€“ Present**
I was hired by the Army as an operations research analyst where I leveraged data science to enhance efficiency and inform policy decisions. I developed multiple courses of action and performed cost-benefit analyses to improve program performance.

- **Data Validation & Quality Assurance**: Designed and implemented data verification and validation processes for contract deliverables, improving accuracy and reliability. Developed tools for analyzing reports, supporting manufacturing cost estimates for 80% of procurement-funded elements, earning the **Achievement Medal for Civilian Service**.
- **Cost Reduction & Efficiency**: Determined that switching to an alternative system would save 18% in long-term costs (~$31M) and reduce average annual operating costs by 19%.
- **Data-Driven Analysis & Strategic Planning**: Developed cost estimates for billion-dollar contracts, informing source selection and acquisition planning. Conducted cost-benefit and break-even analyses impacting billions in lifecycle costs for the **Stryker combat system**, directly influencing strategic decision-making by Army leadership.
- **Budgetary Forecasting & Resource Management**: Analyzed large datasets to develop and validate cost estimates and budget forecasts, ensuring accuracy and reliability for multi-million-dollar Army programs. Developed tools for analyzing spend plans and visualizing program impacts for congressional review. Managed budget inputs and assessed impacts across current and future fiscal years, identifying and recommending data-driven corrective actions for deficient program areas.
- **Process Improvement & Team Leadership**: Interim team lead and mentor to junior staff. Taking initiative, created and presented an advanced Excel class, boosting various departments' efficiency and analytical speed by ~10%. Developed and utilized advanced analytical tools for data validation, visualization, and model building to improve workflow.
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration & Stakeholder Engagement**: Partnered with program managers to implement data-driven modernization efforts. Coordinated with multiple agencies to establish the Supply Chain's critical surcharge, resulting in a 24% adjustment in part costs to ensure cost recovery on over $200M in parts, which led to the team receiving awards for three consecutive years. Supported source selection and acquisition planning, securing project approvals from senior leadership.

### **Mathematics Tutor, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI | Aug 2015 â€“ Aug 2016**
Hired as a part-time mathematics tutor while enrolled at Michiganâ€™s third-largest university to provide outreach and support to the veteran community, while also contributing to increased mathematical literacy across the student body.

- **Multidisciplinary Math Tutor**: Tutored a diverse student body in a wide range of mathematics courses, from foundational math to advanced subjects such as differential equations, linear algebra, and quantum mechanics.
- **Individualized Instruction**: Leveraged deep understanding of mathematical concepts to tailor tutoring sessions to individual student needs and learning styles, facilitating effective problem-solving and comprehension.
- **Professional Development**: Participated in weekly mathematics seminars to expand knowledge and expertise in advanced mathematical fields and concepts.

### **United States Marine, United States Marine Corps**
Inspired by childhood experiences as a war refugee and recipient of American aid, I enlisted in the Marine Corps during a time of war to serve the nation that offered me a second chance.
