## Work Experiences

### **Data Validation & Quality Assurance**  
- Designed and implemented data verification and validation processes for contract deliverables, improving accuracy and reliability.  
- Developed tools for analyzing reports, supporting manufacturing cost estimates for 80% of procurement-funded elements, earning the **Achievement Medal for Civilian Service**.

### **Cost Reduction & Efficiency**  
- Determined that switching to an alternative system would save 18% in long-term costs (~$31M) and reduce average annual operating costs by 19%.

### **Data-Driven Analysis & Strategic Planning**  
- Developed cost estimates for billion-dollar contracts, informing source selection and acquisition planning.  
- Conducted cost-benefit and break-even analyses impacting billions in lifecycle costs for the **Stryker combat system**, directly influencing strategic decision-making by Army leadership.

### **Budgetary Forecasting & Resource Management**  
- Analyzed large datasets to develop and validate cost estimates and budget forecasts for multi-million-dollar Army programs.  
- Created tools for analyzing spend plans and visualizing program impacts for congressional review.  
- Managed budget inputs and assessed impacts across fiscal years, identifying and recommending data-driven corrective actions for deficient program areas.

### **Process Improvement & Team Leadership**  
- Served as interim team lead and mentor to junior staff, creating and presenting an advanced Excel class that boosted departmental efficiency and analytical speed by ~10%.  
- Developed and utilized advanced analytical tools for data validation, visualization, and model building to improve workflow.

### **Cross-Functional Collaboration & Stakeholder Engagement**  
- Partnered with program managers to implement data-driven modernization efforts.  
- Coordinated with multiple agencies to establish the Supply Chain's critical surcharge, resulting in a 24% adjustment in part costs to ensure cost recovery on over $200M in parts.  
- Supported source selection and acquisition planning, securing project approvals from senior leadership and earning team awards for three consecutive years.

## Skills

- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL  
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit Learn, TensorFlow  
- **Tools & Platforms**: Excel, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, Deep Learning  
- **Other Expertise**: Statistical Analysis, Data Modeling, Applied Mathematics, Physics

## Career Highlights

- **Data Science/Analysis**: Created detailed cost estimates from big data, aiding successful bids for a $1.5 billion government contract.  
- **Cost Optimization**: Identified potential savings of $276.9M (78%) by modeling and evaluating alternative courses of action.  
- **Research and Modeling**: Conducted novel research in physics by applying advanced mathematical modeling and Python simulations.
